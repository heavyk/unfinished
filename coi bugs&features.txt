(right) click on right-side product should bring up stats
  - already displaying stats on sidebar so weird to see a list of products

vehicles list (for easy upgrades)
- ability to edit the names
- click to goto/follow
- also nice for JD to see all the names

recipe panel clicking on the greyed out machine should take me to the research
  - also would be nice to have it show the little popup shown in the "UNLOCKS" section of  research panel containing power/people/maintenance/cost requirements so I can compare recipe quantities for each higher tier machine

storages power cost don't show in research panel
growth boost requires >1 health, says requires 1

shift+pause toggles the building paused state, not construction (or vice-versa)
flip/reverse tool (like unity tool) - maybe holding shift w/ unity tool selected flips

fuel truck top-up
- when a fuel truck is on return trip back to station, fill any other diggy & choppy boys up nearby (also nearby idle trucks?)
- when fuel truck is idle at the station, do diesel tasks in the main queue (like fill fluid strorages that want diesel)

tree harvester
- when unassigning a truck, it's possible to unassign a truck that's currently being loaded (loading only part of the currently chopping tree)

chem plant
- fertilizer recipe seems like it's missing water as an import bc/ 12 nh3 + 18 o2 == 30 units -- does o2 + nh3 produce that much water? 2x h3 + 3x o2 = h6o6 -- shouldn't it be 2x o2 + 2x h3 = o4h6, h2o+h2o+h2o

cargo docks
- see ETA for ship

deconstruct when pipe/belt is empty (pay unity up front)
when constructing w/ unity, all items are set to construct when unity is available (building turns purple?), and so construct w/ ubit always works -- just wait till next month
6-way pipe connectors


ODDITIES
for CO2, small smokestack provides dumped/disposed, but large smokestack goes under "total consumption"
vehicle delivered construction doesn't obey partially loaded option (if 30/100 parts are available, it'll take 30 immediately instead of waiting for 60)
weird that it shows cargo ships found/repaired (but NOT  'used / free'  OR  'used / total')
DOCKED (can say if the crew is unloaded/loaded)
muntiple clicks in the same area should rotate through entities in z-order, insatad on only picking top-most
weird that concrete mixer 3 is in basic computing tech, but requires no computing. feels like it should go in construction 4 or its own tech.



INTERFACE STUFF
ability to place connectors anywhere
enable connectors to be beside one another (even though they still don't work)
place calculator reselt in small textbox above search field, allowing transports/buildings panel to stay where it is.
when pressing 't' to open transports, and calculator resumt is showing, it should open transports, not close.
when clicking on (cargo ships 1/1) on top, should open a panel with a list of all cargo ships and their current status (docked, arriving, departing, eta), thier cargo modules and cargo (maybe), reduce fuel option, workers, gas tank, pause button
when clicking on (vehicles 140/140) on top, should open a panel with a list of all vehicles and their current status (idle, navigating, eta), thier cargo (maybe), gas tank, pause button.
when mouse scromming over notifications where there are more than 5(?), it scrolls the notifications

vp2 on top of sand bar
(left side)
	import limestone, do cement, import coal
	*vp2 build*,
	import iron, mine copper, electronic2
	cp4 production
slag for sw (get rid of slag mountain)
remove need for forestry (remove planters&harvesters, import from rubber & household appliances)
exhaust scrubbing for oil/incineration
import coal (for cement), h for cement

coal power up top (looks like it goes down to -3) (use gw pumps)
electronics 2 on right side needs rimming and diesel refinery for hydrogen/chlorene/naptha)
electronics 2 also up top (use copper & rubber)

biomass to compost (less waste)

move digger up to dig dirt
put rows of 6x farms up left
put town up top & connect farms/food to it


-----

walls for coasl ramp
glass (BELT)
coal import/mine (top)
use hydrogen so diesel isn't slow


move diggers to limestone
desal recipe
front dirt bucket request dirt

export rubber
plug in exhaust
sand ramp to iron
ramp in front of copper

----

goat pipe crude (24 pumps for 450 pipe
tree planting squares
don't dig coal ramp

town/water/rubber/poop priorities
turn off diesel power
sand accept assigned only
reverse coal lps pipes

---

bricks (and soon smelters) exhaust pipe down to scrubbers
expand slag mountain & slag contract
BACKWATER PRIORITY
24x 24 lp steam
24 desals
16 pumps
10 dumps

priorities for water and power (venting steam & exhaust scrubbing)

---

move farms over to 
find water for farms (diesel on pier? -> desal?)
e2 for use hydrogen
crack heavy into naptha -> diesel, (whatever's left) fg -> H 


hydrogen power
==============

3x boilers @72 = 216
18fg*8 = 144fg
24np*4 = 120fg + 24sw


move vp2 to left coast
out in e2 where the tech labs are
