while watching optics puzzles 1-4, I wrote this: I was learning qwerty at the time, so my sentences are quite short (cause it took me forever to write them)

your explanations helped me to see the mental image in my head better.
I think a perhaps more intuitive explanation to why sugar make light twist, is to think of sugar like a non-polarized capacitor.
imagine each layer in the medium (or sugar) being very slightly "charged" by the incoming light.
so, when the light is positive, it's charging the capacitor in the positive direction, giving it a delay to reverse directions.
the capacitor taking longer to discharge, slows down the frequency a bit, giving that "kickback" effect.
the chirality of the sugar seems to alter the angle that the light is retransmitted on the other side of the molecule.
(it's probably related to the two 5-sided and 6-sided loops being offset in the molecule but not sure)

imagine for a momnent capacitor in a DC circuit, where it's being pulsed (the alignment of sugar to the light's polarization).
the capacitor will have more time to charge at higher frequency pulses (think full bridge rectifyer), and less at lower frequencies.
this gives the sugar the sense of having more "mass", where higher frequencies charge/discharge/move the "mass" more.

a line of pool/bowling balls hitting the next is going to propagate slower than just one unimpeded one.
each impact is like a charge of the the capacitor (obvously angle matters): the amount of energy retained by the impact is its charge.

light bending in air can be thought of like a planet/comet being shot through a galaxy: as if approaches a star, it speeds up.
as it approaches the star the angle will be changed as it goes away from the star (like a comet).
if it impacts the star/nucleus, then the energy is transformed into something else (like a CME), and sent out to the next star (or stays within the heloisphere).
if the next star is really far away, the new enerrgetic mass is not likely to make it, so the charge gets trapped ("resistance")
a structured medium like a crystal/metal will have regular intervals between the stars, and so it's much easier for a planet/comet to go in a straight line (wiggling a litte).
some nuclei resonate/attract the charged particle to it more than others (creating resistanace/impacts).
impacts are transformative, so it's better for the star/nucleus to be different vibration than the (charged particle) passing through.
snells law simplifies this by saying that (generally) a change in the medium's star density/structure will affect the angle of the planet/comet/mass passing throgh it.
stars/nuclei vibrate too; irregularly like in a galaxy, and structred crystals/metals too like the plane of charged particles.

I noticed that the sine wave being the y-component of a rotating vector explanation, the center there would be the sun and deconstructive interference is L3
if I were to imagine all of the planets in orbit of our star that would produce a resulting wave by adding all of their vectors over time.
take that frequency of our solar system, then if I were to imagine a planet or large comet nearing the our star (assuming it has a simiar frequency as the planets),
it would shift back the frequency of the solar system, and the planet would shoot out the opposite side at that angle of the phase difference (snell
