I will likely have a lecturer in the future explain that I initiated the fourth phase of belief and understanding reality, replacing "world religions", in the form of feeling-purposefully.

is the progression from one to another inevitable? I think so. (if we reframe the idea as frequency and resonances as the "source" of order, then we're all creating that "order" by the way we feel and conceptualise our reality)
ritual capture of animism energy -> pagan ritual of placating the "gods" (concepts) through ritual -> ritual "right" living (and don't stray from it)
    obviously, why do good things still happen to those that don't observe, and bad things still happen to those that do.

I actually plan to revisit this lecture, and I wrote these notes down to remind me to do it. looking at what he talks about from a conceptual framework of gradients and resonances, it's easy to see why this is so... hmmm maybe I'll do that later, actually..
