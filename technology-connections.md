# technology-connections

as an example, imagine a musician plqying a song live -- and the frequency response of the sound equipment was infinite, to where tthe speakers cconnected to the amplifiers are capturing producing frequencies well beyond anyone's capacity to hear. those inaudible high frequency harmonics that the live audience is hearing and experiencing can be thought of like the most evolved version of a cOncept -- yet we don't have technology capable of capturing those really high frequencies, so it gets recorded at 44KHz (or whatever inferior bitrate) instead. those inferior recordings are the concepts that our brain uses, even though the much higher frequency versions of that song still exist.
  and one day, we'll figure out how to tune into those moments/sounds in the "past", considerably improving all recordings we've done of past shows and things like that
    obviously, this technology isn't ready for mainstream, because you could listen/experience more than just a concert in the past. however, I disagree with this supposition though, as when we're able to tune into the past like that, we can tune into *any* past timeline -- making our certainty that *that* timeline is actually the one that brought us to the present, meaning that not only could that technology be used to "whitewash" history (ex. tuning into an alternate timeline concert where the musicians played their songs significantly better)
